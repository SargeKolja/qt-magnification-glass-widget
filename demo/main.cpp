/**
 * Project "Magnification Glass Widget for Qt"
 *
 * demo/main.cpp
 * 
 * Just want to zoom into your QWidget/QLabel Windows like having a mag glas? 
 *
 * You are welcome, here we go!
 *
 * This is mostly a simplified implementation of sub window which
 * can take a rectangle of your currently viewed image (taking from the underlaying full res image)
 * and opens a floating, frameless window around the mouse cursor wit a magnified view of what is 
 * around the mouse pointer.
 * Zoom further in/out via wheel is possible
 * calling as function or via signal/slot
 *
 *
 *
 * Plans:
 * add SIGNAL/SLOT very soon
 * add QSettings store/restore
 * add subclassed QWidget which already owns all we need for graphic with Mag Glass, so one can derive from this
